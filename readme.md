About
-----

This fork was originally intended to turn [Switcheroo](https://github.com/kvakulo/Switcheroo) into a virtual desktop manager, however after adding some tweaks to make it work better with multiple monitors and the mouse that idea was abandoned. 

Changes
-----

- Main window is centered below cursor when opened
- Single-clicking an item will switch to that window
- Windows now open on the monitor the main window is on
- Clicking an item with the middle mouse button will close that window
- If closing a window fails (most often due to a "save changes?" prompt), the window will be displayed
